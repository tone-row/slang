# To Do

- add tabs for different examples and include a little summary explaining the point of the example
- turn animation into a css animation that's only there when a class is toggled and the user is _not_ hovering over the entire wrapper
- a playground where you can drag components into a text editor and see them compose together
- an walkthrough of building a design system using these building blocks
