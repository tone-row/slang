# To Do

- Find out why rows/columns when passing an as to the subcomponent, doesn't successfully add padding and margin
- Add tests to rows/columns
- Figure out how to classify **visual group use-cases** (list, rows, columns) using overflow as a central theme
- how should you deal with overflow?
- should column be a way to make something full height??? HOw can we help people get things full height that need to be to be effective? Should we use context???
- Should we err towards things not inherting from each other because we're going to combine them ourselves? For example when creating the user would stick a Box inside a Container, but we would morph the two together??? Or should we work from inheritance?
- turn on ESLInt badassness include jsx-a11y
- BAD TYPING â€“ collectionWrapper
