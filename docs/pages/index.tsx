          Welcome! This the documentation for the open source UI component
          library called Slang. It's not quite ready to use but it will be soon.

          Why?

          The idea driving Slang is that we can do a large part of what's needed
          to style our applications with a small number of abstractions. In
          fact, Slang offers only <u>two</u> exported components.

          The internet has a had a zero-runtime approach to styling since 1996.

          Whenever possible we use CSS over an equivalent from the javascript
          ecosystem. This includes bundling:{" "}
          <InlineCode>&lt;link rel="stylesheet href="..."&gt;</InlineCode> is
          already great at that. It also includes dynamic styles, for which
          psuedo-classes and css custom properties have our back.

          Although there are plenty of reasons we still need media queries,
          there is a lot to be gained by making our designs more fluid at the
          lowest levels. Slang has fluid type and fluid spacing units built in,
          as well as a continuous exponential type scale. The result is a lot
          better use of screen-space over a broader range of devices.
